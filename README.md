# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix titles dataset to understand content distribution, trends, and patterns across Movies and TV Shows.

The analysis explores how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved over time using visualizations, aggregation techniques, and trend-based modeling.

## Dataset
- Source: Netflix Titles Dataset
- Rows: 8,807
- Columns: 12
- Each row represents a unique movie or TV show available on Netflix.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Highlights
- Content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Year-wise release trends
- Country-wise content contribution
- Rating-wise distribution
- Initial genre extraction and aggregation
- Handling missing values and data cleaning
- Trend analysis using linear regression for Movies and TV Shows

## Key Insights
- Movies dominate the overall Netflix catalog, while TV Shows exhibit stronger growth trends in recent years.
- The United States and India are the largest contributors to Netflix content.
- Mature ratings (TV-MA, TV-14) account for the majority of titles across both content types.
- Regression-based trend analysis shows steady long-term growth but highlights the non-linear nature of Netflix’s expansion.
- Linear regression is used as a baseline trend indicator and not as a forecasting model.

## Notes
Trend extrapolations in this analysis are intended for high-level insight and should not be interpreted as precise predictions due to the non-linear evolution of Netflix’s content strategy.
